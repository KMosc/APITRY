## Welcome to MonteCinema API Page

I've dedicated my time to develop that API during Monterail Rubycamp.
### About the project

The App uses multiple gems such as:

```markdown
# Database
  -'pg'
# Authentication
  -'devise'
  -'doorkeeper'
  -'bcrypt'
# Scheduling Jobs
  -'sidekiq'
# Tests
  -'faker'
  -'simplecov'
  -'byebug'
  -'rspec-rails'
```
It uses as well multiple gem/tools

```markdown
# Tools
  -'redis'
  -'brakeman'
  -'bundle-audit'
  -'sentry-ruby'
  -'sentry-rails'
# Heroku addons
  -'scout_apm'
```

# Website Functionalities

### What user can do during using the site?
```markdown
Each user can
  -Log in
  -Log out
  -Create account
  -Get list of ticket desks
  -Get list of Cinema Halls.
  -Get list of movies that are playing
  -Get list of empty seats for the movie
  -Get list of tickets that is linked to their email
  -Buy a ticket
    -You get confirmation on email.
  -Make Reservation
    -Your ticket is gonna be deleted if you dont pay 30 minutes before movies start.
```
<br/>
### Know How
<br/>
### Wrap your mind around the API, How It all works.
The project has multiple components. Lets start the reading.

## Relationship between models. Database schema.
```markdown
# There is Ticket that belongs to:
  -user, based on email. User email is unique!
  -movie
```
Each movie is as well seance. It has its starts' date and ends' date. It has referece to cinema hall, where ticket gets number of total tickets for choosen movie.

# How ticket recognization works?
```markdown
- You can take only take ticket thats' seat is declared in empty seats list.
- Each cinema hall has its volume.
- the API creates empty seats list accordingly to volume of cinema hall, each row has max. 10 seats
```
<br/>
# How the Authentication works?
```markdown
# What does happpen in controller once You create an account?

## Creation of account
-User_controller checks 
  -if your params[:email] is email,
  -if params[:password] has desired length.
-It searches if params[:client_id] is equal any of Doorkeeper::Application.uid, either 
  -It returns error message.
# Creation of Token
-It creates Doorkeeper::AccessToken using your client_id,Doorkeeper::Application.uid and reftoken
-Two the same refresh tokens cannot exist
  -it checks in database and returns the one that not exist". 
    -Each token has some expiration date.
-After creation, it renders the nessesary information for user to log in:
  -auth token type, expiration date, access_token
## Log in
-Every time we want to log in to authorized page,
-It checks if our token exists in Doorkeeeper::AccessToken and is assigned to our account.
-If we want to refresh our access_token expired.
  -We log in, we use client_id, client_secret, email and password, new token is assigned.
```
